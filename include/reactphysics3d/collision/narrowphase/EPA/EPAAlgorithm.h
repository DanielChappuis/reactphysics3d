/**
 * This class is the implementation of the Expanding Polytope Algorithm (EPA).
 * The EPA algorithm computes the penetration depth and contact points between
 * two enlarged objects (with margin) where the original objects (without margin)
 * intersect. The penetration depth of a pair of intersecting objects A and B is
 * the length of a point on the boundary of the Minkowski sum (A-B) closest to the
 * origin. The goal of the EPA algorithm is to start with an initial simplex polytope
 * that contains the origin and expend it in order to find the point on the boundary
 * of (A-B) that is closest to the origin. An initial simplex that contains origin
 * has been computed wit GJK algorithm. The EPA Algorithm will extend this simplex
 * polytope to find the correct penetration depth. The implementation of the EPA
 * algorithm is based on the book "Collision Detection in 3D Environments".
